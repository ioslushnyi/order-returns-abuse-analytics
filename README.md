#WIP: order-returns-abuse-analytics
The idea behind this project is to showcase the usage of PySpark for processing large volumes of data - in this case - 2-5M of orders over couple of years.
The second main thing is to apply dbt for modeling order returns data and creating analytical queries for further usage in dashboards.
